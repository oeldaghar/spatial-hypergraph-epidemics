knobs to turn
- choice for f(|h|,|h â‹‚ I|)
    - sqrt(|h|) normalization
    - |h| normalization 
    - |h|^2 normalization. may need to push up epidemic parameters to see this one
- alpha in hypergraph interpolation 

potential 
- take min past first phase flare up and use it as new initial conditions
- figure out parameters for larger oscillations in the steady state.

Counterfactuals
- average degrees 
- R0? or R_t
