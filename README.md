# spatial-hypergraph-epidemics

This repo is the code and data accompanying conference paper [A spatial hypergraph model where epidemic spread demonstrates clear higher-order effects](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12688) for ComplexNetworks2024. The data for figures is cached and one can reproduce figures by running the figure*.jl files.
